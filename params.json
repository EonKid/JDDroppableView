{"body":"DroppableView\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nA `DroppableView` represents a single draggable View. You may use it as a base class for the views, that you need to be draggable in your project. Currently it is built, to be used within a scrollView. But this could easily be changed.\r\n\r\nThe demo app demonstrates, how the `DroppableView` may be used in a project.\r\nThe `DroppableView` is used as a subview of a `UIScrollView` and can be dragged within and also out of the scrollview.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nInitalize the DroppableView like in th following example:  \r\n\r\n- `aScrollView` is the parent scrollView\r\n- `target` is a view outside of the scrollview, to where the element should be dragged.\r\n\r\n`- (id) initWithScrollView: (UIScrollView *) aScrollView andDropTarget: (UIView *) target;`\r\n\r\nand add it as a subview to your `UIScrollView`.  \r\n**Note**: Your `UIScrollView` needs to set `canCancelContentTouches = NO;`.\r\n\r\n### Screenshot of the example app:\r\n\r\nThe black cards can be dragged from the red scrollView onto the green circle.  \r\nTry it!\r\n\r\n  \r\n![Screenshot](http://www.bilderload.com/bild/189325/droppableviewIRGWX.png)","note":"Don't delete this file!
